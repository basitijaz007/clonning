Hello guys, so welcome to all of you on the Manhwa Breakdown channel. At the beginning of the story, some guys are talking among themselves that Suchan has changed a lot, right? The coward who used to wet his pants just by seeing us—today he is roaming around as the hero of the entire campus. Inside the whole campus, no one has the courage to look God More in the eyes. And this Suchan has not once but many times shouted in front of everyone and said “I love you” to her.

All of us awakened very amazing professions, and that Suchan couldn’t even awaken. Even after that, he can do all those things which we cannot do. Making the biggest bully of the campus his dog, making the most beautiful goddess crazy about him, and showing the most shameless couple their place. How did he do all these things? How did he change so much?

Then our Suchan says, I have not changed. I also have a story. I have just become very powerful compared to before. It is because of my system. In exchange for this power, this system is making me do a lot of things. I have some tasks—some are dangerous and some are deadly. But if I tell the truth, I am enjoying doing all of this a lot. And this fun, I want to give to everyone. So come on, let us see this amazing story of mine—how I will become a hero from zero.

At the beginning of the story, we see our main character Suchan, who is doing push-ups. Only four push-ups were left to complete his 10,000 push-ups. But then Suchan becomes extremely tired. Suchan is saying that after coming into this body, Sister gave me my first task, and that task was to do 10,000 push-ups. I don’t understand my system at all—does it want to kill me?

While he is thinking all this, his best friend comes into the room. Jilong says, idiot Suchan, what are you doing here? Don’t tell me that you have forgotten that today is the awakening ceremony. Our turn is about to come. Hurry up. Suchan says, just give me one second. I had four push-ups left to do. Jing says, the ceremony is not a joke. We cannot waste time at all. Come with me quickly. After coming back, you can do as many push-ups as you want.

On the other side, we see all the students who have arrived at the stadium for the ceremony. Everyone is talking among themselves that if we awaken a combat profession, it will be amazing. And if we even get a mage in that, then it will be icing on the cake. Then our future life will be very great. Some guys are talking that if we get a support profession, our life will be difficult, but we will survive.

The other students standing on the ground are saying that today Sister Murang is also going to come to the awakening ceremony. Sister Murang is the biggest genius of our second academy. After graduating, no one became as famous as she did. If we get her autograph, it will be amazing.

Meanwhile, Zilong says, see, because of me we didn’t get late. Then Suchan tells that my name is Suchan, and seven days ago on Earth there was a very dangerous earthquake. Because of that earthquake, my soul traveled through dimensions and came here. This is a world where as soon as someone turns 18, they participate in the awakening ceremony and awaken a profession. And professions are of many types.

All professions are divided into three categories. The most important and valuable is combat profession. From the name itself it is clear that people of this profession are very good at fighting. Second is support profession, and the last is life profession. Doctors and similar people come under this.

Then a girl named Jhalu awakens as a mage. Happily, Jhalu says, I can’t believe it. I became a mage. Shocked, everyone says—she is the third-year student Jhalu, right? Earlier when we used to see her, she looked very ordinary. But after becoming a mage, now she looks like a goddess.

Zilong says, Suchan, you’re lucky. Look, your girlfriend became a mage. Suchan thinks, I would have been happy if this girl were my girlfriend. But the reality is that the real owner of this body, Suchan, chased Jhalu for two whole years. Every time, this girl rejected his flowers and letters without even looking. But when this idiot Suchan gave her an armor set that was very expensive, she immediately said yes to becoming his girlfriend. Don’t know why this idiot was even after such a girl.

We see that because she became a mage, there is a line of boys behind Jhalu. Boys say, now this stadium feels like a museum to us, because such amazing miracles can happen only in a museum, not in a stadium. Other boys are also giving their pickup lines, but Jhalu doesn’t give attention to anyone.

Jhalu thinks, in my fate the sky is written, so why should I pay attention to insects crawling on the ground? Suchan says, Jhalu, congratulations. Jhalu says, Zhengli, you came at exactly the right time. I wanted to break up with you. Suchan says, but my name is Suchan. Jhalu says, maybe there was a mistake. Let me check the list first. Then while looking at the list she says, whoever you are, I’m breaking up with you.

Irritated, Suchan says, listen carefully with your ears. I never liked your double battery face, nor will I ever like it. What breakup will you do? I am breaking up with you.

Then a guy comes and says, Suchan, if someone else had said these things, maybe we would have believed it. But didn’t you propose to Jhalu? Didn’t you stick to her like an insect for two years? So what’s the big deal if you don’t even remember the name of that insect?

That guy says, Jhalu, there is no need to pay attention to such useless people. I awakened as a shooter just a little while ago. You should stay with me. I agree that my profession is not as amazing as yours, but still it is much better than this trash. Come on, let’s celebrate together tonight.

Jhalu says, Brother Lingxiao, tonight we will eat famous seafood. Lingxiao says, you are talking about seafood here? If you had asked for the stars of the sky for dinner tonight, I would have brought those too. Ziling says, Lingxiao, stop talking nonsense. Has your father ever even seen a star? How will you break one and bring it?

Ling says, Ziling, your house is two floors and mine is twenty floors. I have seen you closely, so don’t talk nonsense here—keep your mouth shut. Ziling says, jump as much as you want. Until now my friend hasn’t awakened. If he had, your filthy mouth wouldn’t even open.
Ling is talking here, saying, “Come, let me tell you how much possibility there is for your friend to awaken a commoner profession. In our entire college, only 20% of students are able to awaken a commoner profession. And even among them, 90% are people like me who belong to noble and powerful families, and since childhood they had good supplies. Yes, Zhoul is completely different. He is a very talented person. Apart from him, most commoners only get very low-level professions, and your friend Suchan will also get something worthless.”

Just then, it is announced that the next turn is student Suchan’s. Suchan says, “My number has come. Ling Jia, you wait right here. When I come back, you will come on your knees and call me daddy.”
Laughing, Ling says, “Only time will tell.”

Suchan thinks, “I have been transported into this world. I crossed dimensions and didn’t come here just to awaken something basic. I came to show the entire world what I can do. I can hold this whole world in my fist. My name is Suchan. My height is 6 feet 1 inch. Using my power, I will make such scoundrels surrender, because they don’t have the courage to even pick a fight with me.”

Then Suchan’s awakening starts. Happily, Suchan says, “World, get ready to kneel down, because your real boss is about to appear.”
Just then, the system announces that Suchan has not awakened any profession.

Shocked, everyone says, “What kind of joke is this?”
Laughing, Ling Jia says, “How useless can a person be that the system says he is not even worthy of any profession? Honestly, Suchan, this is exactly what I expected from you.”

Other students say, “Some people get good professions, some get bad ones, but someone getting no profession at all — this is the first time we’ve seen this. Can we say that Suchan is the number one trash of this entire world?”

Suchan says, “System, you can’t do this. I didn’t cross dimensions to come here just to awaken something basic. I worked so hard. Show some respect.”
Ling laughs and says, “What happened, Suchan? Didn’t you get satisfied even after coming to the basic realm? That you’re still standing there trying to awaken?”

Suddenly, the weather changes. Shocked, all the students say, “What just happened? How did the weather change? Is it possible that like the heroes of Manhwas, Suchan is awakening a profession so powerful that even the surrounding weather is changing?”

Suchan says, “I knew it. A magnificent person like me can’t be trash. Come on, quickly show everyone what I can really do.”
Shocked, Ling Yao says, “How is this possible? A commoner having a profession that can change the weather? Honestly, I’ve never heard of such a thing before.”

Ling Jia thinks, “Did I break up too quickly? Well, it’s fine. I’ll patch things up again.”
Suchan says, “Ling Jia, start calling me dad. Look, your father is becoming powerful.”

Then we see a dragon coming out from the sky. Everyone says, “This is not a phenomenon. An actual portal has opened here, and monsters are coming out of it.”

We see that because of the dragon’s attack, Suchan is thrown backward. An announcement is made in the stadium, “Everyone move to shelters. Normal students and teachers cannot handle this.”

Suchan thinks, “There is something wrong with this world. Why is a transmigrator like me not getting respect here?”

Some students move forward to attack the dragon, but in just one attack, the dragon shows how weak these students really are. People on the ground say, “Sister, where is she? She was supposed to come here. This monster is a B-level monster. Only Sister Murong can face it. We can’t do anything to this dragon.”

Running, Jiling says, “Suchan, what are you doing there? Come here quickly or you’ll be killed.”
Ling Jia says, “It would be better if this scoundrel just dies.”

Suchan says, “A dragon is standing in front of me. How can I run away?”
Then the dragon moves forward to attack Suchan. Suchan says, “Dragon, wait one second. Before you finish me, I need to finish my task.”

Doing push-ups, Suchan thinks, “Anyway, no one can save me here. Maybe if I complete the system task, I might survive.”
People watching Suchan say, “Has he gone mad? What is he doing? Who does push-ups at a time like this?”

Ling says, “Haven’t you realized yet? He’s completely scared. Whatever comes into his mind, he’s just doing it.”

Then Suchan completes the push-ups. The system announces, “Host, you have completed the task. As a reward, you are being doubled, and you have obtained the skill Power Charge Punch.”

Suchan says, “Power Charge Punch? Is it powerful?”
The system replies, “As the name suggests, the more charge you put into your punch, the more powerful it becomes. The more anger you have while punching, the stronger the punch will be. Since this is your first time receiving this skill, you can use one punch as a trial. You don’t need to set any angle value for it.”

Then the dragon attacks Suchan. At the same time, Murong arrives and says, “This is not good at all. I must stop this.”
Suchan says, “Let’s see what this Power Charge Punch can do.”

Murong and Suchan attack at the same time, and because of that attack, the dragon completely explodes. Happy, all the students say, “Look, the dragon is dead! And the one who killed it is none other than Senior Sister Murong.”

Everyone comes out and starts praising Murong. But Murong says, “Something feels strange. Did the dragon really die because of my attack?”
Suchan says, “I have to admit, this punch is amazing. System, you gave me only one power, but that power is incredible.”

Ling Jia says, “That’s why Sister Murong is so famous. Who knows how many people in this city are there who can face a B-level—” They can finish a Rank monster in a single attack.
While Lu is saying, “My goal is that I will surpass Moorang.”

Meanwhile, while coming down, Moorang is thinking, I know my powers very well.
That attack was not enough to kill a B-rank dragon.
Was it really this boy who killed that dragon?

Just then, the Second Academy’s principal comes running there.
The principal says, “Hello Miss Moorang, my name is Principal Changan, and thank you very much for helping the academy’s children.
Do you know all these children have been waiting for you for so long?
Now that you are here, please say a few words.
This will give these children a lot of motivation.”

“And Suchan, why are you standing here? Go down.
Don’t block Miss Moorang’s view.”

Moorang says, “Principal Changan, wait one second.”
Just then the system announces:
Host, there is a new mission. You have to shout ‘I love you’ to Miss Moorang 100 times.

Shocked, Suchan says, “System, you’re going to get me killed.
Why did you give me such a task?”

Moorang asks, “Student, what is your name?”
Suchan replies, “My name is Aashiq, and my job is to do romance.
Senior Sister Moorang, I love you.”

Hearing this, everyone there gets completely shocked.
Principal Changan says, “What nonsense are you talking?
Suchan, is your mind in the right place?”

Moorang says, “I wanted to ask you if you were the one who finished that dragon.”
But Suchan doesn’t listen to a single word and keeps shouting “I love you.”

The principal says, “Son, calm down.
What are you even doing here?
Someone come quickly and take him outside.”

Even while being taken away, Suchan keeps shouting “I love you.”

Ling Xia says, “This Suchan is a complete idiot.
He doesn’t know what to do and where.
Even young masters can’t dream about Sister Moorang, and he’s dreaming about her.
Reaching her will remain only a dream for him.”

Zhalu says, “Lingjia, I awakened, but I don’t have skill books to train.
If you have skill books, can you give them to me?”

Lingjia replies, “Yes, I can.
How many books do you need?
As far as I remember, my family definitely has five books,
but to take them out, I’ll have to ask my father,
and I won’t get his permission easily.”

Tearing a slip of paper, Zhalu says,
“Fine, from today I am your girlfriend,
and this is proof that you are my boyfriend.”

Taking the slip, Lingxia says, “Alright, thank you.”

On the other side, we see Suchan being thrown outside the academy.
The students there say, “Suchan, you’re completely crazy.
By confessing in front of Sister Moorang, you made yourself a loser in front of everyone.
Now everyone will ignore you in the trials.
Anyway, you don’t even have a profession.
What’s the benefit of keeping someone like you?”

Suchan says, “If you think about it, saying ‘I love you’ is easier than doing 10,000 push-ups.
If I had stayed for five more minutes, I would’ve completed the task.”

Just then, some guys surround Suchan.
Standing up, Suchan says, “What happened, uncle? Did you need something?”

Annoyed, the guy replies, “Your father is the uncle.
My name is Lilei, and people lovingly call me Brother Handsome.”

Lilei’s men say, “Brother, he’s acting on purpose.
This bastard probably doesn’t have this week’s protection fee.
That’s why he’s pretending not to recognize us.”

Suchan thinks, Now I remember.
This guy may look like he’s 40, but he’s actually 18.
He’s the biggest bully in the entire academy,
who takes protection money from weak students.

The owner of this body never had a good life.
When he was very young, his parents passed away,
and after that he lived with his uncle and aunt.
The uncle was a very good person who cared for him a lot,
but the aunt and the rest of the family hated him.
Because of this, he was bullied everywhere—from school to college—
and he had no option except to endure it.

Lilei says, “Quickly take out the money.
If you don’t give it to me, I’ll shave your head.”

Suchan thinks, Now that I’m inside this body,
how can I let him be bullied?
90% of people get bullied because they never stand their ground.
Today I’ll show how the whole world bows before a courageous person.

Saying this, he punches Lilei.
Staggering, Suchan says, “Why was this charged punch so weak?
If I don’t give enough charging time, its power becomes very weak.”

Lilei says, “You coward got the guts to attack me?”
His men say, “Idiot!
Don’t you know our boss awakened as a tank?
Your weak punches can’t do anything.
From today, you’re going to get beaten badly.”

Lilei says, “Earlier you had to give 1,000.
Now because of your stupidity, you’ll give 10,000.
If you don’t, you’ll get beaten badly.”

Suchan says, “Give me a few hours.
I’ll collect the money and give it to you.”

While leaving, Lilei says,
“I’ll come outside your room in the afternoon.
Keep the money ready, or you’ll get beaten for sure.”

Suchan says to himself,
“Half a day is enough to charge my punch.
But since I have free time now, I should complete the system’s task.
If Moorang leaves once, my task won’t be completed.”

On the other side, we see Principal Changan buttering up Sister Moorang.
Changan says, “Someone as talented as you studied in our academy.
It’s truly a great honor for Second Academy.”

Just then Suchan appears again and starts shouting “I love you.”
Annoyed, the principal says,
“Child, you came again? Guards, throw him out quickly.”

Later, they enter the conference room.
Changan says, “Miss Moorang, you know the martial exam is less than a month away.
I want you to share your experience with these children.
It will be very beneficial for them.”

Moorang replies, “It’s not about experience.
To be honest, my profession was very powerful.
That’s why I achieved all this in my life.”

While they’re talking, Suchan appears at the window,
shouting “I love you” loudly again.

The principal says angrily,
“Suchan, why don’t you listen?
Once I say stop, you should stop.”

Despite this, Suchan doesn’t stop.
The principal says,
“Miss Moorang, please don’t mind.
This poor child couldn’t awaken today,
so he’s deeply affected.
I think his mind isn’t working properly.”

Moorang thinks, What?
A person who couldn’t awaken?
Then I must have been wrong about him.
He couldn’t have helped kill the dragon.

Changan orders, “Throw him out and tape his mouth.”

Moorang says, “Don’t worry. I’ll handle this child myself.”
She flies to Suchan.

Panicking, Suchan says, “What are you doing?”
Picking him up, Moorang says,
“You’ve been showing how crazy you are for so long.
Now I’ll show you how crazy I am.”

Changan says, “Suchan is finished.
Now Moorang will take him to the sky and throw him down like a basketball.”

After all, everyone is forgetting one thing—
Moorang was the biggest bully of her time.
At Tianfo Academy, everyone knew her as The Great Demon.
Talk to her politely while you can,
because once she loses control, she’ll do things we can’t even imagine.

Suchan says, “Aren’t we going too high?”
Moorang replies,
“If you love me, you can go to the moon with me.
So the sky is nothing.”What’s such a big deal about going? Look, I’ll leave you like this. If before hitting the ground you say “I love you” 50 times, then I’ll believe you.
Suchain is saying, you’re joking, right? I don’t like jokes like this.
Moorong is saying, you know I also don’t like joking. If before falling and dying you say 50 “I love you,” then I’ll accept you as my boyfriend.
Saying this, she lets go of Suchain.

While falling, Suchain is saying, this girl is more crazy than my system.
But even then, our hero does not lose hope and while falling he keeps continuously saying “I love you.”
Panicking, the academy teachers are saying, he’s gone. After falling from so high, he will definitely die.

While saying “I love you,” Suchain is thinking, I’m going to die. This damn system is really very bad. Everything that’s happening here is because of you.
Just in time, Moorong saves Suchain.

Moorong says, I believe now that you really like me.
Suchain says, you are a very big devil. How can one human be so cruel to another human?
Moorong says, you don’t just like me, you understand me very well too. Many people call me devil-ish.

Principal Chagan, now I’ll leave.
Suddenly, a portal opening and a dragon coming out of it is not a normal thing. I’ll have to tell my teacher about this.

Chagan says, Miss Moorong, wait a second.
Do you know, that day was a golden morning for our academy, when you topped the entire province. After that, our academy’s level has fallen a lot. We used to always be on top. But now the First Academy and Third Academy have gone far ahead of us.
Miss Moorong, you have been a student. Please do something for your academy.

Then Moorong takes out the Siano Academy admission card.
While leaving, Moorong says, in the fresh trials, whichever student brings Rank One, I will give them a skill from my side that only someone of a profession can learn.

Happily, the teachers say, what, a skill that doesn’t need a special profession? Truly, this skill will be very useful for our children. Miss Moorong is very kind. She helped our academy a lot.
Principal Changani says, now I’m confident that in the entrance exam our college will perform very well.

On the other side, Suchain is thinking that girl Moorong is very dangerous. She dropped me from such a height just like that.
Well, it’s a very good thing that my tongue is very fast and I said “I love you” 50 times in time. Otherwise, my game would have been completely over.
But if you look at it, even now 100 are not completed. I don’t understand how I’ll complete my mission. Now she has already left.

Then we see Leele and his men, who are waiting for Suchain.
Entering the room, Leele says, Suchain, quickly take out our 10,000. Otherwise I’ll beat you so badly here that you won’t even recognize your face in the mirror.

Using his strength, Suchain throws him out of the gate.
Panicking, Leele’s men say, how is this possible? A guy without any profession—how can he injure a tank?

Suchain says, fine, I admit I hit you lightly here. If I had put power in my punch, you wouldn’t have survived today.
Panicking, Leele says, brother forgive me, I was wrong.

Suchain says, bull, your name is Leele, right?
Leele says, please brother forgive me.
Suchain says, do you know Han?
Leele says, no, I don’t know.

Hitting Leele, Suchain says, then why don’t you know? You roam around college all day and you don’t know Han? Now go inside the college and find someone whose name is Han. Until you find him, I won’t forgive you.
Leele says, I’ll put my full life into finding Han. But brother Suchain, who is he?
Suchain says, even I don’t know.

Scene changes.
We see Principal Chagan motivating all the students.
The principal says, within the next one month, exams will start, and to prepare you for that exam, you’re being sent to trials. Try to level up and reach One Star there.

First, Second, and Third Academy are conducting the trials together. We want students of all three academies to grow together. Don’t fight with students of other academies; it will affect your trial scores.
Everyone form teams of three to five people, because the trials are about to start.

Everyone starts forming teams, but no one comes to Suchain.
Suchain says, I don’t need to form a team with anyone.

Then Jiling comes to Suchain and says, where were you?
Suchain says, like me, did you also not find anyone?
Jiling says, no, that’s not the case. But honestly, you shouldn’t team up with others.

Principal Chan says, Suchain, what are you saying? Quickly form your team.
Linjia says, Principal sir, you don’t understand this poor guy’s pain. It’s not that he doesn’t want a team—the reality is that no one wants to take him. A guy without a profession, who would take him?

Other students say among themselves, Linka is absolutely right. Suchain is complete trash; we won’t take him in our team.

Then a man comes down from a helicopter.
He says, Principal Chagan, am I late?
The principal says, no, you came exactly on time.

Everyone listen carefully. A prodigy from First Academy has transferred to our academy. He’ll participate with you today.
Moving forward, the guy says, hello everyone, I’m from First Academy. Don’t think transferring means I’m extremely talented or very handsome. I just came here to make myself better.

All the girls say, really, how amazing this guy is. Such a great body and so handsome, yet so humble.
The boys say, brother, be a little confident. You don’t need to be so modest.

Then the guy says, fine, now I’ll tell the truth. My name is Wei Bai Hui, and I came here for Sister Moorong. By getting first rank, I’ll make a place in her heart. And after coming here, I’m sure—first rank is mine. Because trash like you can never beat me.

Angrily, everyone says, this guy is showing off too much. We must teach this bastard a lesson.

Then Principal Chagan says, Wei, go form a team with Suchain. Anyway, Suchain doesn’t have any profession. If you stay with him, he’ll be safe.

Then everyone enters.
While entering, students are saying, we have to somehow reach the first level. After reaching there, we must Fighting will become very, very easy for us. We see that while waiting for Suchain and Jiling, half an hour has passed, but even after half an hour, that guy still does not come to them. Suchain is saying, “Jiling, which profession do you have? And even after having a profession, why did you not team up with anyone?” Jiling is saying, “I am a warrior.” Happily Suchain says, “What? A warrior? This is a common profession, mainstream. You are very amazing.” Feeling shy, Jiling says, “But the name of my profession is Magical Girl Warrior.” Suchain says, “Can you transform? I want to see you transforming.” As soon as Jil transforms, he becomes a girl. Suchain says, “Brother Jiling, I have a very amazing idea.” Then, getting irritated, Jiling hits Suchain.

Transforming back, Jiling says, “Suchain, are you okay? After transforming, my temper changes a lot. Inside my mind there is only one thing: cut everyone.” Suchain says, “Jiling, you are amazing. You yourself don’t know what a big miracle you did.” तभी from them Baihui passes. Suchain says, “Baihui, you were in your team, right? We were waiting for you here since yesterday. Why didn’t you come?” Baihui says, “Were you waiting for me?” Jiling says, “Is straw filled in your brain? Principal Changan said we have to form a team with you. That’s why we were waiting here for you.” Baihui says, “With weak people I do not form a team. I will go inside alone.” Suchain says, “Okay, then go inside and get beaten alone—then don’t come to us to ask for help.”

Stopping, Baihui says, “I know you—your name is Suchain, right? With Sister Murang you publicly confessed love. Listen to my words with ears open. Your Sister Murang has been insulted a lot, and her insult I cannot tolerate. You cannot even think what she is for me—she is the goal of my life. If my heart is mine, then she is my soul, and my nights pass thinking about her. In my phone there is her number. Still, this heart fears to say anything to her. And in such a situation, you cheap person went and said ‘I love you’ on her face. Truthfully, I have controlled myself a lot here, otherwise seeing you I feel like beating you right here. In this competition I will come first place so that in my life I can follow Sister Murang. No one can stop me from following her.”

As soon as Baihui leaves from there, Lily comes there. Lily says, “Brother, what are you both doing here?” Suchain says, “No one wants to form a team with us, so then how will we enter?” Lily says, “Surely all of their brains have gone bad, that’s why those donkeys are not forming teams. I am here, right? Come, let’s form a team.” Then Lily’s girlfriend says, “Has your brain gone bad? This is Suchain who has no profession.” Lily says, “Even if he has nothing, he has very amazing punches. I have eaten his punches. I know how strong he is.” Lily’s girlfriend says, “You will have to choose. If he stays in our team, then I will not stay.” Lily says, “I am telling you, he is very powerful. If he stays in our team, we will get benefit, no loss.” Girlfriend says, “No, you must choose—either me or him.” Lily says, “Okay. Then leave.” Getting angry, girlfriend says, “Lily, what are you saying? I am your girlfriend. You are leaving me for a loser?” Lily says, “If someone will truly weaken our team, it is you. I can’t listen to useless nonsense about my brother.” Angry, his girlfriend says, “Lily, you are a very big bastard. Watch—I will join a very powerful team and enter inside, and I will score much better than your team.” Suchain says, “Brother Lily, you are a sigma man. Have to say, you did an amazing job.” Lily says, “Brother Su, I believe only one thing—brotherhood should be on top. As for girls, they change like the weather.” Suchain says, “Okay then, let’s enter.”

After coming inside, Jiling says, “Compared to outside, this place is really very different. Here I can easily feel the energy.” Suchain says, “Before us, all the other guys have already come. So because of that, we won’t find any monsters like this. To find monsters we will have to go inside.” Going ahead into the forest, they see two Pig Masters. Suchain says, “Pig demons are the weakest. We can attack them and earn points.” Lily says, “Yes, I can see. In the ground there are two monsters—one is a pig and the other is also a pig.” Suchain says, “Lily, stop talking nonsense. Quickly go and finish the monster.” Lily says, “Brother Jiling, he is telling you to kill the monster.” Jiling says, “I will not go.” Lily says, “Brother Su, you go.” Suchain says, “You’re saying I should kill such weak monsters? You both watch these pigs. On such weak monsters I will raise my hand? And Lily, you are so strong-bodied and your monster fear is bursting. Come on quickly, go ahead and finish them.”

Lily says, “Brother, you don’t understand. If I kill the main monster, something very bad will happen.” Suchain says, “Stop nonsense and go kill them.” Then Lily goes in front of the monsters and finishes both. Suchain says, “Truly he is very strong. Now I understand how he was bullying the whole campus.” Then Suchain says, “Wait one second. From where are these voices coming?” When they look to the side, many big monsters are coming forward to attack them. Jiling says, “There are so many. How will we kill all these big monsters?” Lily says, “My main profession is Tank Warrior, but I also have a special attribute. I have such a physique that attacks monsters. Like suppose I killed one pig, then all pigs around will quickly come to attack us.” Running, Suchain says, “Then why didn’t you tell this earlier?”

Scene changes. We see Jhalu and his team fighting monsters, but before Jhalu can kill the pig monsters, all the monsters run away from there. Angry, Linsia says, “What is happening here? Why are all big monsters running?” Then another guy says, “Look there—these monsters, all the big monsters are running in one direction.” Jhalu says, “Crimson big monsters are the weakest in this whole area. If they leave, then how will we increase points?” On the other side, running, Jiling says, “About 100 monsters have followed us. Brother Su, what do we do?” Suchain says, “Do you see the valley? Let’s go there.” After entering the valley, Suchain says, “All of you come behind me. The time has come to finish these monsters.” Shocked, Jiling says, “Suchain, have you gone mad? How will we kill so many monsters?” Suchain says, “Just come behind me and see what I do.” Then using his charge punch, Suchain finishes all of them at once.

Scene changes. We are shown the principal office scene. We see the principals of all three academies watching the trial scores. The first academy principal says, “Principal Changan, what are you looking at? By staring, the ranking will not change. Rank one will be First Academy. Most of top 10 kids are from our First Academy. And rank one is with us. You know, till the end we will dominate. Today your academy will not even get a number.” Then the third academy principal says, “Our prodigy is on rank two. Our Third Academy is also in a good position. But here the Second Academy people have nothing to say. Brother Changan, why are you not saying anything about rankings?” Principal Changan says, “We are also not performing badly. Our academy kid is on fourth rank.” Principal Hung says, “Principal Changan, didn’t you feel shame before saying that? From your academy, on fourth place is that Baihui, and everyone knows Baihui was a First Academy student who took transfer half an hour before the trials started.” Principal Li says, “No matter—Second Academy kids are all trash. That’s why they are stealing our kids. Principal Changan, have to say, you have fallen very low for rank.” Principal Changan says, “Transferring kids is a very common thing, and if you want, you can also take kids from our academy. I didn’t stop you.” Principal Huang says, “What will we take from your academy? Your academy is filled with trash. If we search, our academy has completely crushed your Second Academy. In this ranking we will come above you and everyone will know Third Academy is much better than Second Academy.” Principal Changan says, “Trials are not finished yet. Here no one knows what the final ranking will be.” Principal Li says, “The kids who have made place in top 10—now these will stay in top 10. In this list nothing much will change.”

Then we see rank one—Suchain comes, who has total 98 points. Shocked, Principal Hung says, “What happened? Second Academy student Suchain has reached 98 points.” Principal Li says, “Who is this Suchain? Before today I had not even heard this kid’s name. From where did he suddenly get so many points? Second rank has only 36 points, and he has 98.” Shocked, Principal Changan also thinks, “How did this happen? Our Suchain doesn’t even have a profession. How did he cross everyone and come to rank one?” Changan says, “Huang, you were talking a lot here and showing off in front of us. What happened—your mouth is closed now? Why are you not saying anything now?” Also Changan thinks, “It doesn’t matter who comes rank one—whoever makes the academy’s name will be my favorite.” Hunglin says, “Surely some mistake happened. It can’t happen that a person suddenly reaches so high.” Changan says, “As soon as our kid reached rank one, everyone is getting jealous. Everyone knows the system is automatic. Till today no mistake happened in it—so how will it happen today?” Hunglin says, “I’m sure some error happened. Go check right now what problem is coming.” Laughing, Principal Changan says, “Go go, find out. You thought after this style you would surpass us, but your dream got crushed in front of your eyes.”

Inside, shocked, Jiling says, “What happened? Suchain killed all these monsters with one punch.” We see that after killing the monsters, Suchain’s body starts glowing. Suchain says, “What is happening?” Jiling says, “Suchain, my brother, you did a breakthrough. Now your profession has reached one star. At the start of the trials Reaching one star, you proved that you are the biggest genius of this entire trial. Suchain is saying, “I have reached one star, but I don’t even have a profession. Because of this, I am not feeling any changes inside my body.” The scene changes. We see two bald men who are fighting wolf monsters inside a valley. The first man is saying, “These small one-star monsters think they can face us. But these poor things don’t know that we are already at one star. No matter how much they try, they cannot harm us.” Then the second man says, “We should not focus on monsters here, but on our work.” The first man says, “Yes, you are right. Even though everyone here thinks this space realm is new, they don’t know that this space realm is 1000 years old. Even a thousand years ago people used to enter it, and at that time this place was not like this. Now we will activate this place and make it what it used to be.”

As soon as they activate the crystal, a big door appears there, and many monsters start evolving there. Shocked, the second man says, “What is happening here?” The surroundings completely change. Even the monsters become very powerful. The first man says, “Something is wrong. This door is not opening upward.” Then the wolf monsters attack them. Dodging the attack, the first bald man says, “Their strength has increased a lot, and all those monsters that were at one star have reached two stars. But how did all this happen here?” The second man says, “We activated the lock, and because of this the monsters here evolved. One thing must be said—we all have gotten stuck in trouble.”

On the other side, Lily says, “Brother Suchain, truly you are very amazing. Your fear is so strong in monsters that as soon as they see you, all monsters run away, and we don’t even have to fight them. Anyway, all the pig demons around were finished by you. Now to find more monsters, we will have to go to the castle.” Just as they are moving forward, their eyes fall on chicken monsters. Jiling says, “All these monsters are on war mode, and compared to pigs, these monsters will be very strong.” Then another girl comes and says, “For the last half hour we have been searching for monsters. Finally, we found a monster.” We see that this girl is from Lily’s girlfriend’s team. Lily says, “Zhengzui, we saw this chicken monster first, so we will be the ones to kill it.” Zhengzui says, “Lilai, I agree that you are powerful and you have enough strength to kill this monster. But the problem is that you have Suchain with you, and because of Suchain your team has become very weak. Even if you kill one monster, you won’t be able to kill the rest. That’s why let us kill this monster here.”

Lily says, “Brother Su, she is taking you lightly. Show her what you can do.” Suchain is thinking, “My punch that I had is charging now. Now I am nothing more than an ordinary human.” Lily says, “Jiling, I know you are not going. You go and show these people what we can do.” Jiling says, “No, I will also not go.” Lily says, “No problem, then I will go.” Stopping him, Suchain and Jiling say, “No, no brother, you should not go. If you go here, this time we will not survive.” Zhengzui says, “Lily, see for yourself how useless your team members are.”

Then Third Academy people arrive there. Announcing, one man says, “Third Academy’s Huwang has arrived here, so all others clear the field.” Lily says, “I have heard a lot about this Huwang. He is one of the top students of Third Academy, and the special thing about him is that he is Principal Huwang’s son.” The Third Academy man says, “Second Academy people, listen carefully to my words. All the monsters here will be killed by our brother Shaoqin. You cannot touch them.” Lily says, “Why, did your father reserve this place, that only you will kill all the monsters here?” Then stepping forward, Zhengzui says, “Brother Shaoqin, did you not recognize me?” Shaoqin says, “Yes, you are Sister Zui, right? Except Zhengzui, all Secret Academy students here—get out of here. You have no work on this field.” Zui says, “No brother, don’t remove them. Show them what real strength is called, so their illusion can break.” Wansh says, “If you are saying, I will surely do it. By the way, you know Zui, I bought a new villa, and my cat can do backflips. Do come to my house to see it.”

Then Zhengzui’s team starts attacking the chicks. Zong says, “All three of them are armored warriors.” Lily says, “Yes, we can say their team is very powerful. But compared to us, they are nothing.” Zhengzui says, “Lily, have you seen how strong my team is? Leaving me and taking Suchain with you was your biggest mistake, and I can write it down that you will surely regret this mistake. When you come out and see the ranking, and you find that your team is at the last rank, then you will surely feel great regret.” Moving forward, Huang Shakin says, “I am a sportsman. Now I will show everyone here what is called real strength.” Saying this, he attacks the monster. Zhang Zhe also says, “Brother Huang, we will support you.” They are just about to attack when the entire mountain starts shaking. Shocked, Huang says, “What is happening here?” Then the chicken monster evolves. Shocked, Huang says, “What happened to it?” But then the chicken monster attacks and injures all of them. Jiling says, “It has reached from one star to two star. And now it has become Chaos Chicken. And how is this possible? How did a one-star monster evolve?”

Lifting Huang, his friends say, “This monster has become Tusha. No matter what we do here, we cannot face it. Brother Huang, let’s get out of here.” Then Zhengsi comes to Huang and says, “Please take me with you. I am very injured and I cannot move. If you don’t help me, I will not survive.” Huang says, “Bitch, stay away from us.” Then we see the monster badly injures Zhengzui’s teammate. Zhengzui says, “Brother Huang, I cannot move at all. You promised me that you would take me to your house. If you leave me here, I will die.”

Hitting Zhengzui, Huang says, “Look, bitch, whether you live or die makes no difference to me. I am not going to keep a burden like you with me.” Zhengzui says, “If you don’t save me, then who will save me?” But completely ignoring her, Huang runs away from there. But then Chaos Chicken appears in front of them. Panicking, Zhang says, “Brother Huang, now what do we do? It has come in front of us. We are not going to survive.” Wang says, “Don’t take tension. My dad gave me a very amazing item. This item will save us.” Saying this, he throws a ball toward Suchain. Shocked, Suchain says, “What is this thing?” Jiling says, “Suchain, throw it away. This is an artifact that attracts monsters. If it explodes, all the monsters will follow us.”

But it becomes too late, and the ball explodes, because of which all the Chaos Chickens start chasing them. Happily, Wang says, “Look how good a person I am. You asked me for monsters, and I gave you all of them. And however many you want to kill, you can kill.” Shouting angrily, Suchain says, “You bastard. Because of you, I am getting very angry. After killing them, I will definitely beat you.” Huang says, “To beat me? You won’t even survive. These Chaos Chickens will finish you right here.”

Panicking, Zhengzui says, “Everything is finished. What should I do now? I cannot run from here. This monster will definitely kill me.” Shouting, Li says, “We are standing here, and even then you are losing hope.” Zhengzui says, “All three of you are number-one trash. You cannot even save yourselves. What will you tell me?” Then Chaos Chicken ignores Zhengzui and moves toward Suchain, attacking our hero and throwing him to the side. Lily says, “Brother Su, are you okay? Bastard monster, I will not leave you. How dare you attack my brother?” Then Jiling says, “Don’t fight. I will handle all of them here.” Saying this, Jiling transforms. Shocked, Lily says, “What happened?”

While fighting, Jiling says, “This monster is very powerful. Suchain, I am holding it here. You all leave from here.” Zhengzui says, “Okay, hold it. Till then, we are leaving.” Suchain says, “Lily, help me. Jiling is making a very big sacrifice for us. We should not waste his sacrifice.” We see that Jiling is having a lot of difficulty fighting. Zhengzui says, “What happened? Can’t you hear? Let’s leave from here.” Suchain says, “You go, don’t eat my brain. I will not leave my friend and go anywhere.” Zhengzui says, “You don’t even have a profession yet. What will you even achieve by staying here? Truly my luck is very bad that I met trash like you.” Then Suchain slaps her. Suchain says, “Keep your mouth shut in front of me, otherwise I will not spare you.” Angry, Zhengzui says, “Did you hit me?” Lily also hits Zhengzui and says, “Shut your mouth. Brother Suchain did a very good job here. You deserve to be slapped.”

Because of two monster attacks, Jiling becomes very badly injured. Suchain says, “Jiling, you rest. I will handle these Chaos Chickens.” Jiling says, “Suchain, these monsters are very powerful. Handling them alone will be very difficult.” Angry, Suchain says, “These bastards attacked my brother. Today I will not forgive them.” Saying this, Suchain punches with his full anger, completely blowing the monster apart. Happily, Lily says, “Brother, what an amazing punch. You are just like One Punch Man.”

Suchain thinks, “When I first got this punch, the system told me that the power of the punch depends on two things. First, how much time I give to charge my punch. Second, my anger value. Now I know how many punches I can throw using my anger value.” Shocked, Zhengzui says, “This is absolutely impossible. How can Suchain have so much power? Maybe we already injured this monster badly, that’s why he killed it in one punch.” Then we see more Chaos Chickens coming toward them. Zhengzui says, “Now we will not survive.” Suchain thinks, “In my last punch, I used half of my anger, and now I have very little anger left to punch. I need to increase my anger. I have to smash all of them here.”

Then Suchain, getting angry at Huang, punches the monster. But with such little anger, it does not work. Suchain says, “Just taking his name won’t work. I need someone whose name alone makes my blood boil.” Then two monsters surround Suchain. His friends say, “Suchain, be careful.” Angrily, Suchain says, “Since childhood my parents said I am useless. My friends said I am small, and I couldn’t even reply to them. I have a lot of anger filled inside me.” Using his anger, he punches two chicken beasts, killing both. Moving forward, Suchain says, “Since childhood I learned letter writing—writing letters to a distant friend who could never even receive them, wishing happy birthday. It took me ten years to write a proper letter, and it never helped in real life. I have a lot of anger about this.” Then he kills another chicken beast with one punch.

Suchain says, “My school was five kilometers from my home. Going and coming on foot made me very tired. I have anger about that.” Saying this, he kills another chicken beast. “Studying all day, studying all night, and still getting only five marks in tests—I have anger about that too.” Remembering his pains, Suchain keeps killing monsters continuously. Lily says, “Brother, you are amazing. You didn’t just kill monsters—you tore them apart.” Suchain says, “When I was a child, I thought I would become a singer. But after growing up, I realized my voice is bad. I am angry about that.” Saying this, he kills the last monster.

Suchain says, “The monsters are finished, but I am still angry. Where should I release my anger?” Shocked, Zhengzui says, “A guy who doesn’t even have a profession killed so many two-star monsters with one hand.” Suchain says, remembering his last life, “I have understood one thing. In my l ife, I could never do what I thought I would. But in this life, things will not be the same. There is a lot of danger in this world, and I have to save this world from danger and become its hero. To protect this world, I will do anything.”

Lily says, “Brother Su, who are you actually? A mage, a warrior, or Superman? How did you kill so many monsters?” Jiling says, “How is he so powerful? I also don’t understand. But as shocked as I am, I am equally happy.” Outside, we see in the rankings that First Academy’s Lishuang reaches 106 points and surpasses Suchain. Principal Li says, “Liangna is doing very well. She pushed Suchain back and reached rank one.” Hunglin says, “My Third Academy has also reached second rank. Principal Chengan, your Suchain has come to third rank. What will you say now?” Chengan says, “Third rank is also a very good rank. I am not like you people who scold their children even when they perform well.” Manglin says, “Stop talking nonsense. This guy Suchain is not famous at all. That means he reached first rank only using luck. This child is not talented at all. Slowly everyone’s ranks are increasing. I think Suchain will be thrown out of top 10.”

But then Suchain again reaches rank one, and this time he leaves everyone else behind by 100 points. His total points become 128 points. Principal Li says, “What? That Suchain has again reached rank one? He left second place behind by 100 points. How is this child doing all this? What kind of joke is this?” Principal Chengan says, “This is not a joke, son. This is the power of our children. They don’t show off. They don’t make claims. They just do their work and keep tearing people like you apart.” Hunglin says, “Now I am sure. There is definitely a problem in this system. How is he suddenly reaching rank one again and again?” Chengan says, “When your children reach rank one, they are capable. When our children reach rank one, the system has a problem? The reality is that you are jealous of them.”

Then the screen turns red. Shocked, the principals say, “What happened? How did an issue come in the trials?” Wanglin says, “This means it is clear that now your Suchain cannot come rank one. Surely this was the system error.” Then a man comes and says, “Principals, a problem has occurred. Inside the space realm, many changes have happened, and the entire space has evolved. Now it is not one star but two star.” Shocked, all principals say, “Then what will happen to our children?” What happens next will be seen in the next episode. Till then, bye and stay tuned.
